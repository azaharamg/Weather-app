# What Should I Wear Today ⁉️⁉️

Web application developed in React to check what's the weather like anywhere in the world. Visit it at the following [link](https://advice-weather-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

Users can write the localization (city name, post codes, ...) to check the weather there. Then the application will do a request to [API OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch the data and finally show it to the user

The application gives information about the date, temperature, humidity, and wind. Also, according to meteorological conditions, the background of the app changes and the app gives advice about what kind of outfit is better for the current weather

## Objectives and technical tools

-   Layout with pure CSS
-   To deploy the project to Heroku
